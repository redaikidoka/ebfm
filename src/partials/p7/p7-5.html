         In Alaska’s Bering Sea crab and halibut and sablefish fisheries, low-interest loan programs help new fishermen buy quota.  Individuals typically must be crew members buying small amounts of quota to qualify.  New entrants to the fishery may borrow up to 80% of the cost of the quota;  to qualify, an individual’s total quota ownership must be below a limit. The loan programs have been successful in helping new entrants and those who own small amounts of quota acquire more viable quantities of quota.

         In the halibut and sablefish fisheries, eligible community entities are able to purchase quota to be fished in the coastal community by residents. While the program has not been used to a great extent, it remains in place to help communities get into the longline business.
