         The creation of America’s 200-mile EEZ—a boon for fishermen and coastal communities—spurred one unfortunate consequence: The race for opportunity at sea drove vessel owners to overbuild. By the 1990s many fleets were too crowded to thrive. There are no painless solutions when the adage comes true: “Too many boats chasing too few fish.”  The North Pacific’s catch share programs emerged from this crucible. All required years of careful –and very public—balancing of socio-economic and ecological needs.  Do they deliver?

         In many ways yes, though caveats come with the terrain. Dividing the allowable harvest into individual or cooperative shares ends the “race for fish.”  This has yielded real-world benefits for fishermen and communities in the North Pacific. In halibut and sablefish, Bering Sea pollock, crab and non-pollock groundfish, Gulf of Alaska rockfish, catch shares have delivered:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>Improved compliance with commercial halibut and sablefish catch limits</li>
         <li>Reduced overcapitalized fleets and vastly increased efficiency for long time participants</li>
         <li>Improved crew safety</li>
         <li>Increased earnings for active vessels and crews</li>
         <li>Enabled improvements in product quality, product forms, and value-added.</li>
         <li>Strengthened capacity to reduce bycatch, especially in trawl fleets</li>
         <li>Included measures to lower barriers to new entrants and fishing communities in crab and halibut/sablefish</li>
         <li>Increased Community Development Quotas to benefit Western Alaska</li>
         <li>Crab crewmembers received right of first offer on crab quota shares. They snapped up 60% of all direct quota transfers in 2015-2016.</li>
         <li>Alaska community ownership of crab quota grew by 62% during the first six years of the crab program in Bristol Bay red king crab, and by 68% among snow crab catcher vessel owners.</li>
      </ul>
