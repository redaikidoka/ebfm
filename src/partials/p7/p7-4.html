      <h3>Community Development Quota benefits in Western Alaska</h3>
   </div>

   <div class="large-12 columns">
      <p>
         The Council first proposed reserving a portion of allowable harvests for Western Alaska coastal communities back in 1991. Today Community Development Quotas (CDQ) groups are a rising power in the North Pacific. No longer just leasing out their quota, they own a large share of Alaskaâ€™s seafood industry.

      <ul>
         <li>More than $521 million in direct wages, payments to resident fishermen, scholarships and training benefits in the decade ending 2011.</li>
         <li>More than $176 million invested in community and fisheries activities in 2011.</li>
         <li>Employment, infrastructure, and median income have improved in all communities.</li>
         <li>CDQ groups in 2014 owned all or part of ~85 fishing and processing vessels (mainly groundfish and crab) and equity stakes in major seafood firms.</li>
      </ul>
