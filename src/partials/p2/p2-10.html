         “Excluder” devices (carefully engineered exit holes in the net) reduce bycatch of halibut and salmon in North Pacific groundfish fleets by taking advantage of differences in fish behavior. Effective designs retain most target fish while encouraging prohibited species (in this case halibut) to leave. Approximately 80% of halibut escaped through this device in experiments authorized by the Council in the Gulf of Alaska, while only 20% of Pacific cod were lost. Use of excluders helps trawlers stay below their bycatch caps, so they can pursue their target species while freeing more halibut for other fleets that depend on this big flatfish. Decades of research by NOAA and industry groups have gradually improved performance of excluder devices.
