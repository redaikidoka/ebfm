			<h4>Leaving Plenty of Fish in the Gulf of Alaska</h4>
			<p>
				 There is a simple reason why the North Pacific supplies about 60% of all US landings by volume.  Stung by the costly memory of foreign overfishing in the region decades ago, managers and fishermen keep catches (blue) and catch limits (orange) safely within levels recommended by scientists (yellow).  They consistently accept some economic pain today in order to sustain plentiful biomass (gray) and abundant harvests tomorrow. Notably, the harvest policy converts uncertainty into precaution. This permits moderate fishing on well-understood stocks, while scaling down fishing on stocks about which less is known.
