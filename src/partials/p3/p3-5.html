         The North Pacific Council turned to NOAA scientists to conduct a camera drop survey of the Bering Sea slope and canyons. The study sought to validate NOAA's coral prediction model for the area, collect information on the density and size of corals, collect data on sponges and other invertebrates known to provide habitat structure, and estimate what portion of the area showed evidence of fishing effects. Results showed that "densities of corals were low" and noted there was "no unique faunal features that distinguished Pribilof or Zemchung Canyons from the surrounding slope areas." The predominant seafloor type observed in the survey was mud and sand substrate. Corals were found in less than 3% of the survey tracks and most were less than 10 centimeters in height. Evidence of fishing on the substrate and biological features in the canyons and slope was also rare.  Based on these findings, the Council determined that deep sea corals in the canyons show "low vulnerability" to fishing but asked NOAA to continue monitoring for changes in coral distribution and fishing effort.
