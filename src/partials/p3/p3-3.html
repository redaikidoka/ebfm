         Bottom trawling has changed in the North Pacific. Today’s trawl sweeps (right)—long cables that herd nearby fish toward the net mouth— are elevated above the seafloor by rollers. Footropes at the bottom of the trawl mouth ride above the seabed on buoyant rubber wheels (left) to protect benthic organisms.

         To avoid harming habitats and creatures on the seafloor, trawlers with bottom-tending gear in the North Pacific have switched from heavy, conventional footropes and sweeps to lighter footropes and elevated sweeps. Rollers are widely spread on sweeps and footropes to limit their contact with the seafloor. Vessels have substituted rubber gear and rollers for the steel gear historically used in the fisheries. The rubber rollers and the rubber gear that are commonly used today have 20 percent of their dry weight when submerged in water, minimizing the effect on the seafloor. The Council authorized experimental fisheries to develop this gear, which reduces bottom contact by 80% to 90%. Cooperative research by NOAA scientists and fishermen demonstrated that elevating footropes in this way significantly reduced harm to seafloor organisms—reducing mortality in snow and Tanner crab encountering the gear. The flatfish trawl fleet widely adopted such modified gear to reduce effects on the seafloor even before regulations mandated its use for all flatfish fishing in the Bering Sea and Central Gulf of Alaska.
