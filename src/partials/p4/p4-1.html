         Faced with an urgent need to protect albatross, managers mandated the use of “streamer lines” by North Pacific longline vessels that fish for halibut, sablefish, cod, and other groundfish. Longline crews reel out multiple baited hooks suspended on slender fishing line from a single long “groundline,” baiting the hooks just before they drop into the sea. Because seabirds sometimes dive on the bait,  streamer lines are designed to flap in the wind near the hooks as they descend into the sea behind the vessels—harmlessly discouraging this habit. Research has shown that paired streamer lines can reduce bycatch by 88% to 100% in Alaska. These efforts, along with optional practices such as weighting longlines to sink faster, and natural trends such as changes in bird abundance, have cut albatross bycatch from over 2,000 birds in 1998 to less than 200 birds by 2002, maintaining low levels since then. The number of other birds inadvertently caught also declined.
