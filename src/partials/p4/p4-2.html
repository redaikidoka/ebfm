         These huge marine mammals are shy. That may be why some of them haul out on remote beaches in northern Bristol Bay. When trawlers began fishing for sole near Round Island in the 1980s, researchers noted that more than half the animals quit the area. Fishery managers responded by banning groundfish trawling within 22 nm of the island. They later protected more haulout areas nearby, excluded other fishing methods, and restricted even vessels transiting near haulouts during the walrusâ€™s peak season. In light of new research, USFWS later relaxed concerns about potential disturbance from fishing vessels beyond 3 nm from haulouts. The Council in 2015 therefore partially eased no-transit rules north of Round Island, helping vessels avoid another walrus haulout on Hagemeister Island. The new transit rules allow fishing vessels to access trampers in Togiak without having to go all the way around (saving about 10 hours of travel), while keeping a respectful distance from the big mammals.
