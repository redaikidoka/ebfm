			<h3>Ending Lethal Take of Sea Lions</h3>
			<p>
				 Mortality of Steller sea lions in Alaska commercial fisheries has dropped sharply. With the increasing intensity of domestic fisheries in the early 1980s, an estimated 995 to 1,436 sea lions were killed (via accidental bycatch or predator control). By 2014, fishing bans in sea lion feeding grounds, tighter avoidance rules around rookeries and haulouts, and careful fishing practices had reduced mortalities to an estimated 31.5 animals.  As scientific methods have improved, the accuracy of estimates of Steller sea lion mortality has improved to within one half of one animal – compared to an accuracy rate of within 500 animals when counts were conducted in 1982.
