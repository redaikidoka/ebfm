			<p>
				 Mortality of Steller sea lions in Alaska commercial fisheries has dropped sharply. With the increasing intensity of domestic fisheries in the early 1980s, an estimated 995 to 1,436 sea lions were killed (via accidental bycatch or predator control). By 2014, fishing bans in sea lion feeding grounds, tighter avoidance rules around rookeries and haulouts, and careful fishing practices had reduced mortalities to an estimated 31.5 animals. Scientific certainty has greatly increased: estimates of incidental mortalities today are accurate to within half an animal, compared to uncertainty of nearly 500 animals in 1982.
