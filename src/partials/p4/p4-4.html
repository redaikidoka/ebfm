				 After decades of worrisome decline, the endangered western population of Steller sea lions (map) is stabilizing in US waters, and even rising in the eastern Aleutian Islands (right) and other areas. A 2015 NOAA aerial survey confirmed the trend, showing a modest but sustained growth of 1.94% annually in non-pup counts since 2000. Meanwhile the eastern population (see map) has fully recovered, and NOAA in 2013 removed it from the “threatened” list under the Endangered Species Act,  after observing sustained growth of 4.18% annually, outperforming the 3% target.

				 Causes of decline and recovery are still debated. A nationwide ban on killing marine mammals that sometimes seize fish from commercial fishing gear began in 1990. Following litigation, North Pacific managers in 2000 imposed far-reaching fishing closures and restrictions intended to eliminate any plausible chance that trawlers or other fishing vessels may locally deplete feeding grounds of Steller sea lions in western waters off Alaska. In 2014, NOAA released a new Biological Opinion after two independent scientific reviews questioned much of the previous evidence of prey competition from fisheries and theories about the linkage between fishing and the decline.  The 2014 Biological Opinion included new information from agency and external researchers on causes of sea lion mortality as well as tagging and other studies to evaluate how fishing affects sea lion prey.  Following the  new Biological Opinion, the Council adjusted protections, easing some measures that restrict fishing outside of 10 nm from sea lion rookeries and haulouts. In the western Aleutians the regional population decline may continue, so many restrictions on fishing for Atka mackerel and cod remain in place.
