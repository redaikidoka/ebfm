         Anticipating that new fisheries could emerge as ice retreats, in 2009 the North Pacific Council placed a moratorium on commercial fishing in U.S. Arctic waters until research provides the necessary scientific foundation to sustainably govern fisheries there. Managers chose “to be proactive and precautionary,”  acting “before an unregulated commercial fishery develops,” noting that warming, retreating ice, and lack of research could make Arctic ecosystems especially vulnerable. One example: Arctic waters off Alaska’s western shore are famously rich with tiny seabed-dwelling crustaceans (especially amphipods) and other invertebrates. This resource attracts gray whales from as far south as Mexico to summer feeding grounds where they bulk up for the year by scraping the seafloor, eating about 1.3 tons of food each day. The moratorium protects Arctic feeding grounds from potential fishing impacts.
