      <h3>Steering America’s Largest Fishery Through Changing Waters</h3>
      <p>
         A tight watch on biomass (gray) and incoming young fish enables managers to adjust catch limits quickly as stocks fluctuate for any reason. Between 2004 and 2010, the Council reduced catch limits (TAC, orange) on Eastern Bering Sea pollock by 45%, steering the nation’s largest fishery (by volume) through a decrease in biomass. The stock rebounded. NOAA researchers later linked the decline to foodweb changes during a four-year warm period in the Bering Sea (2002-2005).  They found evidence that many newly-hatched pollock failed to bulk up enough to survive their first winter. Why? The leading scientific hypothesis suggests a decline in prey quality linked to warm conditions. NOAA scientists report that large copepods and krill—rich feed for young pollock—dwindled because they lost access to their own prey due to a chain of ecosystem effects triggered by early ice melt. The return of cold, icy years is thought to have helped to restore strong feed conditions, while tighter catch limits protected the pollock stock’s capacity to rebuild.
