title: Principle 6

description: Do managers adjust fishing rules when environmental change affects stocks?

explanation: Managers adjust catch limits as stocks fluctuate regardless of the cause. But in a changing environment, North Pacific managers and fishermen know that controlling catch is only the first step.

Consider the Pribilof Islands blue king crab.<br><br>
         <p>
            Smaller than a pencil tip,
            crab larvae (above) hatch in an experimental effort to replenish a climate-stressed population that has seen no targeted fishing since 1999, when managers closed it. The Council has been tightening protections for these faltering crabs in the Pribilof Islands since 1995, even halting other fisheries near the islands to prevent modest bycatch impacts.

         <p>
            Currently, stock assessment scientists assume natural reproduction is so impaired—by effects of warming waters and a diminished breeding population—that recovery by natural reproduction is a remote prospect at best. Meanwhile, researchers and fishermen are collaborating in efforts to develop hatchery techniques that may permit humans to give this crab a boost.

         <p>
             Broader strategy:
            The Council proactively anticipated effects of rapid environmental change in the northern latitudes, enacting a precautionary moratorium on Arctic commercial fishing in 2009. Concerned that fishing fleets might follow fish stocks and retreating ice into largely unfished high-latitude habitats, the Council restricted several delicate seabed ecosystems in the Northern Bering Sea. Beyond warming , research on changes in ocean chemistry, circulation, coastal habitats, and marine foodwebs now guides managers in crafting fishing rules to ensure that a changing ocean can continue to feed people—some of whom have relied on these waters since before recorded history.
