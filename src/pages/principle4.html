title: Principle 4

description: Do managers protect non-fish species from fishing impacts?

explanation: As a relative newcomer to Alaska’s oceans, commercial fishing is carefully controlled to avoid harm to long-established residents such as seabirds and marine mammals.

            Because the marine mammals sometimes raid fishing gear, harassing or killing them is banned, and rules now mandate specialized fishing methods for longliners to avoid snagging seabirds. Other protective measures are credited with aiding recovery of the once-threatened eastern Steller sea lion and helping to stop the decline of the mammal’s endangered western population. Research and training on bird-avoidance measures (notably led by Ed Melvin of Washington Sea grant) enabled managers to mandate techniques to ward off seabirds that dive on baited hooks. Curtailing longline bycatch throughout the Pacific is considered a key step to conserve the endangered short-tailed albatross (above), a species mistakenly declared “extinct” after WWII, after feather harvesting (for down) and volcanic eruptions had devastated its main nesting colony on Japan’s Torishima Island.
