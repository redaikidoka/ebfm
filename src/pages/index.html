	<p>During the 1960s and early ‘70s, over 1,000 minimally regulated foreign vessels fished the high seas off Alaska. Alaska fishermen confronted this unruly armada and allied with peers across the nation to demand protection for America’s fishery resources. Together, they persuaded Congress to act: In 1976, the law now known as the Magnuson Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act extended U.S. fisheries authority beyond 12 miles from shore, reaching 200 miles out to sea.  The Magnuson Act established regional Fishery Management Councils to govern harvests in this vast ocean domain. Off Alaska, Americas largest and most coveted fish stocks came under oversight of the North Pacific Fishery Management Council. The Council promptly halted overfishing, rebuilt depleted groundfish stocks, and instituted regulations to begin the transition to a responsible domestic groundfish fleet.  Today the challenge to managers is broader: to conserve not just fish stocks, but whole ecosystems, recognizing that people and marine species depend on them.
