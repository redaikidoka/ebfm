title: Seven Principles for Sustainability

description: How North Pacific Managers sustain America's most prolific fisheries - and the fertile seas that support them.

mission: To promote the conservation and sustainable use of marine resources in the North Pacific for present and future generations by supporting sound science and improved public understanding of critical issues, and to support science-based policy that protects the marine environment and the North Pacific fishing community.

      <h3>Sustainability</h3>
      <h5>How North Pacific Managers sustain America's most prolific fisheries - and the fertile seas that support them. </h5>
      <p>During the 1960s and early ‘70s, over 1,000 minimally-regulated foreign vessels fished the high seas off Alaska. Alaska fishermen confronted this unruly armada and allied with peers across the nation to demand protection for America’s fishery resources.</p>
      <p> Together, they persuaded Congress to act: In 1976, the law now known as the <b>Magnuson Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act</b> extended U.S. fisheries authority beyond 12 miles from shore, reaching 200 miles out to sea.  The Magnuson Act established regional Fishery Management Councils to govern harvests in this vast ocean domain. </p>
      <p>Off Alaska, Americas largest and most coveted fish stocks came under oversight of the North Pacific Fishery Management Council. The Council promptly halted overfishing, rebuilt depleted groundfish stocks, and instituted regulations to begin the transition to a responsible domestic groundfish fleet.</p>
      <p>Today the challenge to managers is broader: to conserve not just fish stocks, but whole ecosystems, recognizing that people and marine species depend on them. </p>

      <h3>Closures</h3>
      <p>
         Area closures have many purposes but, together, they comprise a key ingredient in the development of Ecosystem Based Fishery Management (EBFM) in the North Pacific. This interactive map illustrates the dozens of federally established closed areas around Alaska (dozens more are established under state authority in nearshore waters). At the bottom of the map, a row of buttons (Principles 1 through 7) leads to maps of the federal closures associated with each EBFM principle recognized by the Marine Conservation Alliance.
      </p>
      <p>
         Closures are classified here by their main purpose as documented in public records, but many closed areas were created with multiple purposes in mind. In the early years of council management, closures were primarily established to limit bycatch and potential for overfishing by foreign ships. As those fleets were phased out with “Americanization” of US fishery resources, the North Pacific Fishery Management Council chose to retain some of the existing area closures to manage the new domestic fleets, and established many more. Over time, closures have evolved to serve each principle of Ecosystem Based Fishery Management in the North Pacific.
