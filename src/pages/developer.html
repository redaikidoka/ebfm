		<blockquote> The site is composed mostly of its website code, and graphs and charts hosted on Tableau Public. </blockquote>
		<!--      <div class="columns large-6">-->
		<h3 id="principles">The Website Code </h3>
		<p> The website code is on <a href="https://github.com/redaikidoka/ebfm" target="_blank">github</a>. There is a DOCUMENTATION.md
			markdown file that describes the project (in addition to basic setup in the readme.md)</p>
		<ul>
			<li>You <em>could</em> edit the html files in the ftp site directly, but I recommend grabbing this project and using the build
				process instead - you'll have less work and end up with more awesome.</li>
			<li>The readme.md in the project details the basucs of the ZURB template and how to get it installed. </li>
			<li>The working.md file is a quick reminder of how to get the project going and how to update it as you go. :)</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>The Graphs</h3>
		<p>The graphs all stream in from Tableau Public. You'll need a licensed copy of Tableau Desktop to update them. You can find
			the <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/pol.stafford#!/">Tableau Profile</a> that owns the workbook. </p>
		
				<blockquote> The site access information, like ftp access, the accounts for hosted videos/etc., are held by MCA and <a href="smtp:wordworks9@earthlink.net">Warren & Co </a>. </blockquote>
