		"History": "This closure was originally proposed to conserve crab resouces by reducing trawl bycatch of red king crab, tanner and snow crab.  Additional objectives included limiting potential impacts on seabirds, marine mammals, and spawning herring. The Council approved the closure in 1996 as part of a package: the Nearshore Bristol Bay Trawl Closure, the Red King Crab Savings Area, and additional steps to monitor and reduce crab bycatch. Council action: Amendment 37 to the BSAI Groundfish Fishery Management Plan.  Conservation of crab was a primary driver for this measure.  Crab stocks were in rough shape. Bristol Bay's red king crab fishery never opened during 1994 and 1995 because the population had dwindled below threshold to allow fishing. Conservation concerns also drove the constraints placed on the small \"flatfish box\" that opens April 1 to June 15, subject to a crab abundance threshold and a cap on crab bycatch. Trawling opens in this box only when managers find sufficient crab to allow targeted harvest by crabbers; if there' s no crabbing, there's no trawling either (limiting trawl bycatch and other potential impacts on crab). Trawl bycatch in this subarea is capped at 35% of the allowed king crab bycatch for the rock sole fishery.",

		"History": "Closes trawling for flatfish when bycatch reaches thresholds for red king crab, bairdi Tanner crab, or halibut. The Council established Zones 1 and 2 in 1986 as part of a suite of measures to protect depressed crab stocks and halibut from trawling. Primary aim: to curtail bycatch in the new US trawl fleet delivering yellowfin sole to foreign ships. Council action: Amendment 10, BSAI Groundfish FMP. King crab had recently collapsed, and concern about trawl impacts ran  high.  The Council and NMFS judged the problem urgent enough to pass emergency regulations, which they later institutionalized with Amendment 10.  At first, the Council envisioned this package of measures—  zonal bycatch closures, bycatch caps, weekly catch reporting requirements and new authority to quickly adjust regulations  —as a provisional fix, meant to last two years while they developed a \"more comprehensive\" bycatch strategy. The rules were judged to be effective, however, and they have persisted.   The council later adjusted this bycatch trigger, scaling the cap according to abundance and biomass of red king crab— thus reducing trawl impacts when the crab population is low (see Amendment 37).",

		"History": "Adopted in 1998 as part of the License Limitation Program, this closure prohibits all trawling in an area east of 140 degrees W. longitude.  Motivations included concerns over trawl preemption of local harvests, bycatch, and damage to corals.  Council action: Amendment 41 to the GOA Groundfish FMP.  The history of this closure dates to 1991, when longliners from Southeast Alaska proposed the offshore trawl ban.  Concerns centered around social impacts on local fishers, as well as damage to corals and depletion of rockfish species.  After an analysis in 1992, the Council adopted a rebuilding plan for Pacific ocean perch, Sebastes alutus, the primary rockfish species in the area.  It was not until 1998 that the Council implemented the current trawl closure.  Witherell and Woodby note that the value of this closure is \"difficult to evaluate,\" with Pacific ocean perch stock growth \"primarily attributable to large year-classes produced prior to implementation.\"  Longliners generally regard the measure as a success.",

It also expresses concern about \"incidental catches of halibut\" in the region.  This conditional closure imposed crab bycatch restrictions on the domestic trawl fleet in the area for the first time, as noted by Witherell and Woodby, who conclude that the limits \"have controlled the incidental catch of king and Tanner crabs.\" They also note the infrequency of triggered closures in recent years, attributing this partly to \"changes in the distribution and abundance of Tanner crab,\" among other factors.",

The proposed rule on Amendment 13 notes that the number of walrus hauled out in the area had \"declined by more than 50 percent\" over a two year period, \"coincident with the initiation of fishing for yellowfin sole in the same area.\"  The area was therefore closed to fishing during the season of peak walrus use for a two year period to assess the impacts of such a closure.  After some rebound in the numbers of walrus in the area, the Council made this closure permanent and extended it to include all support vessels in 1991.",

Substantial drops in recruitment of large snow crab and catch limits from 1992 to 1996 caused concern among fishers.  The Council formed a stakeholder committee which ultimately recommended this closure, to be triggered when trawl bycatch reaches an annual, abundance-based limit.  Witherell and Woodby note that the measure has \"eased the concerns of crab pot fishermen\" and that trawl fleets have readily adapted to it.  However, they point out that it \"appears to offer only minor benefits\" in stock conservation, as bycatch accounts for less than 0.1% of the snow crab population.",

The closure also replaced expiring bycatch measures dating back to Amendment 10.  Situated within reporting area 516, this closure has largely been superseded by the Nearshore Bristol Bay Closure.  In recent years, the efficacy of closures for protection of red king crab has been questioned due to changing stock distributions.  In 2013 the Council asked for an evaluation of \"how effective the closures are at protecting against bycatch interactions\" with red king crab.  A 2014 discussion paper indicates that this closure covers an area associated with high crab abundance, and falls within the overarching Zone 1 bycatch area, where the vast majority of Bristol Bay red king crab bycatch occurs.",

Council action: Amendment 78 to the BSAI Groundfish FMP, and Amendment 9 to the Scallop FMP.  According to the Council's Aleutian Islands Fishery Ecosystem Plan,  benthic habitats in the closed waters  are known to be vulnerable to fishing impacts and frequently harbor fished species for at least part of their life cycles.  The Council thus sought to minimize damage from bottom-tending gear without harming local fishing efforts.  The Council's Fishery Ecosystem Plan states that this closure has successfully \"constrained [effort] to historic fishing areas\" while effectively protecting benthic habitat.",

The Alaskan population of Steller sea lions was declared threatened following a decline of around 70% from the mid-1970s to 1991. In response, NMFS defined numerous critical habitat areas in 1993, mainly in the Aleutian Islands, with attendant restrictions on fishing.  These closures - known as protection measures - have evolved over the years, with the latest revision taking effect in 2015.  Their central goal has always been to prevent fishing from depleting sea lion prey species - notably cod, pollock, and Atka mackerel - while minimizing impacts on commercial fishing efforts.  The latest revisions close 90% of AI critical habitat to Atka mackerel fishing, 22% to non-trawl cod fishing, 52% to trawl cod fishing, and 65% to pollock fishing.",

Directed fishing on Kodiak king crab had been closed since 1983, following a stock crash. \"Measures to protect concentrations of king crab, especially when they are in soft shell condition, are needed to facilitate stock rebuilding,\" stated the proposed rule. The amendment restricted bottom trawling where hgh concentrations of female red king crab were noted at Alitak, Towers and Chirikof (and to a lesser extent Barnabas). Type I areas were closed year-round; Type II areas were closed Feb 15-June 15 (considered to be a moulting period). Type III areas (sopen but subject to closure when necessary) were defined later to protect adjacent  juvenile king crab rearing or migratory areas, according to the FMP. To protect concentrations of female king crab, Amendment 26 subsequently defined \"recruitment events\" that could trigger a closure in Type III areas.  Strengthening this optional protection, Amendment 73 later established that Type III areas \"may be reclassified...as type I or Type II following a recruitment event,\" making such closures permanent.",

		"History": "Amendment 60 to the GOA groundfish FMP, implemented in 2002, banned bottom trawling in federal waters of Cook Inlet. Amendment 60 functionally expanded the State of Alaska's ban on bottom trawling within Cook Inlet  (instituted in 1996) to include federal waters beyond the state's three-mile jurisdiction.  This meant the measure closed the wide area near mouth of the inlet. Focusing on recovery of depressed crab stocks, the environmental assessment for this rule noted: \"king  crab fisheres have remained closed since 1984.  Commercial Tanner crab fisheries have been closed since 1994.\" Because no bottom trawling had occurred in this area, the council's action was preventive, affecting no existing fishery.",

		"History": "Federal management of the weathervane scallop fishery off Alaska began with an emergency closure of scallop fishing throughout the North Pacific EEZ in 1995.  The council took that unusual, temporary action (with support from most of the scallop fleet) to halt a single rogue vessel that sailed into Alaska and slipped outside state waters to fish unrestricted beyond three miles from shore, where no clear management authority existed yet. The vessel was defyng a state-ordered closure of the entire fishery to enforce the harvest limit.  After shutting the whole EEZ the council quickly crafted a new Fishery Management Plan for federal waters, delegating most management to the state and affirming Alaska's existing closures. Closed areas today focus mainly on control of bycatch (especially crab) and habitat impacts from scallop dredges; extensive unharvested areas also reflect a precautionary approach to harvest control for scallops, which show \"high susceptibility to local depletion and boom/bust cycles worldwide,\"  (Brawn and Scheirer 2002).  To protect fish habitat, scallop fishing is prohibited in several multi-area closures: Coral Habitat Protection Areas in the Aleutians and GOA, Aleutian Islands Habitat Conservation Areas, GOA Slope Habitat Conservation Area, Alaska Seamount Habitat Protection Areas, and Bowers Ridge Habitat Conservation Zone.",
